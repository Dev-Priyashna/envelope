        To my honeybunch 💕<br><br>
        
        I’m so happy that this Valentine’s Day / Anniversary I get to spend it with the person who makes me the happiest in this whole world.  
        You are my safe place, my joy, and my biggest blessing. I love you with all my heart, and everything about you makes me smile so much I feel like I could explode with happiness.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for all the little things you do for me every day the way you care, the way you make me laugh, the way you love me so deeply.  
        I notice it all, and I appreciate you more than words could ever say.
        <br><br>
        I can’t wait to grow old with you, to share countless more Valentine’s Days, and to keep building our beautiful life together.  
        Cheers to our very first Valentine’s and Happy 4th Month Anniversary, I love you more than you’ll ever know.
